Project Title: Automatd-CI-CD-Pipeline-for-Dockerized-Web-Application-Deployment

Project Description:

My work involved the designing and development of a CI/CD pipeline that automates deployment of a simple application. The pipeline is a full integration of the AWS services which simplifies the whole process from code commit to release.

Key Features:

AWS CodeCommit: An employed AWS CodeCommit as the source control repository of the applicationâ€™s codebase. It was a service that offered a secure and scalable version control system. AWS CodeBuild: Configured AWS CodeBuild to automate the building as well as the testing phases. Consequently, it was ensured that the application was built consistently, and any problems were detected at the beginning of the process. AWS CodeDeploy: Used AWS CodeDeploy for deploying the application, which handled the distribution across different environments. It was a service that allowed for the deployment strategies with little downtime, and thus making the process of updating easier. AWS CodePipeline: Controlled the complete workflow with AWS CodePipeline. The system offered by this service is a complete automation solution for the process, which includes code commit, build, test, and deployment, thus ensuring the pipeline is efficient and seamless.

Outcomes:

Improved deployment speed and reliability Enhanced ability to identify and fix issues early Streamlined workflow, reducing manual intervention Gained practical experience with AWS DevOps tools

This project has not only developed my technical skills but it has also shown me how automation can empower and enhance the software development process.
